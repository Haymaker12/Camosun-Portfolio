For our meetings we set underlying responsibilities to each of us to keep track of, although most of these have been implicit and based on the work we are doing. These responsibilities are based around the principles of professionalism and predetermined responsibilities from our team contract. The responsibilities are, keeping the project well documented, Keeping the sponsor and team members informed of changes or status of tasks, and managing tim to avoid poor mental health while working on the project.
