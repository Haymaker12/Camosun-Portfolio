For our team we had our project organization centered around a weekly Sprint planning, and a daily Monday to Thursday stand up with our sponsor. The scrum meetings have been extreamly effective in our project organization giving us a time to have clear discussion about the next steps in our project and to generate discussion from the sponsor about the content we are are to implement next. A part of our scrums has been note taking for the decisions made in the meetings for our weekly status reports that detail our work.
