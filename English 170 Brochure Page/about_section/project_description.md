## Archipelago's project
The Archipelago is a private company in Victoria which work with the fishing industry, NGOs, and regulators to implement sustainable practices through atâ€“sea and dockside observer programs, electronic monitoring technology, and marine environmental services. At Archipelago a lot of the observation and monitoring they do is based on human review, and using simple sensors to track vessel movement, and equipment use to give simple time frames for activity. Archipelago uses these tools to give diagnostics and monitoring on a web platform. The project goal is to investigate and develop a tool that uses machine learning for object detection to determine what specific objects are being moved on and off the vessel during periods where fish are being hauled.
