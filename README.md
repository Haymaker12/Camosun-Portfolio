# Austin Garat's Portfolio

This is a collection containing all of the projects, large and small throughout my growth at Camosun College. I passed with straight A's based on my personal touches and contributions, be them projects I worked on with others or on my own ability and creativity.

Take all this as you will and understand that I am still practicing and pursuing a larger career in simulations and computer science.
